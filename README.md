# What is Discord Downloader?

Discord downloader is a CLI tool for downloading files from discord channel.
But there is a catch Discord Donwloader is a self-bot and its not approved by Discord so I am not responsible for anything that will happen to your account.

## How to install

You can install the version you want from relases, if you want to run python code directly you don't need any external module to run.
Python version its written in 3.9.5, but it will work on the most of the python versions.
