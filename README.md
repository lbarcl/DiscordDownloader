# What is Discord Downloader?

Discord downloader is a CLI tool for downloading files from discord channel.
But there is a catch Discord Donwloader is a self-bot and its not approved by Discord so I am not responsible for anything that will happen to your account.

## How to install

You can install the version you want from relases, if you want to run python code directly you don't need any external module to run.
Python version its written in 3.9.5, but it will work on the most of the python versions.

# Using Discord Downloader

For discord downloader you need a discord token. Discord token's are changes on pasword changes so you can use it for a long time.

### Accessing discord token

You can access it on Discord web client with Chrome (At least that way I know).
You can follow the steps below to get the token

1. Open Google Chrome
2. Go to [Discord](https://discord.com/app)
3. Open the inpector panel
    - Press F12
    - Ctrl + Shift + I
4. Go to application tab
5. Click to LocalStorage on Storage
6. Find Token key in LocalStorage

Thats the way for gitting the access token.
If you did follow the steps then you should have it.
If you have it then we can continue with our guide.

### Picking the channel

Once you run the program it's going to ask for acces token.
Then Discord Downloader will greed you.

After the greeting It will prompt Discord servers that you member of.
You can pick one of them, there would be indexes for servers you can use it.

Then you will see the channels of server that you chose, you can pick one of them same as picking a server.
Once you chose the channel it will get the all messages that sended to channel.
Time it will take is relative the amount of messages that channel has.

### Downloading the files

When it finished the getting messages, it will ask for the path to save files.
Once you enter the path of directory (it should be absolute path) it will start the download the files and it will filler them by the type of file.
And it will prompt a progress bar with precentage on it.

When the download work is done you will hear a sound from your computer and it will prompt the time elapsed from start.
